A repository for testing jinja facilitated workflows with a dedicated front end team

# Scenario

I have developed a new "killer app" - a combination of a beloved television show, as well as social and professional networking sites.

This site is a static social network for fictional people who work in the same office, and who have posted gibberish in Latin.

People can spend hours browsing this content - I imagine it will replace Facebook, LinkedIn, Game of Thrones, and Latin 1 coursework in high schools across the world in the near future.

Unfortunately, despite it being packed with engaging content, the web UI is (almost) non-existent. 

I have created a barebones web UI for displaying this data, and will happily provide new routes, or alter existing routes, in order to work together
to create a interface through which to present this information.
